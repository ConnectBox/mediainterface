A multimedia interface designed for offline media boxes like the Connect Box.

## Development

This repository is following the branching technique described in [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the semantic version set out on the [Semantic Versioning Website](http://semver.org/).  We use the [AppVersion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appversion) library for managing the versioning of the app.
