[![AppVersion-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-0.0.1-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/delvedor/appversion?#version)

A multimedia interface designed for offline media boxes like the Connect Box.

## Development

This repository is following the branching technique described in [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the semantic version set out on the [Semantic Versioning Website](http://semver.org/).  We use the [AppVersion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appversion) library for managing the versioning of the app.

To add alias for paths, you need to add them to both the `tsconfig.json` file as well as the `config/webpack.config.ts` files.  See [here](https://medium.com/@siddhartha.ng/ionic-3-import-using-aliases-2aa260d6fab3) for more details.  You should also update the paths in `test-config/webpack.test.js`.
